# Neural Network for Predicting Chezy Roughness Coefficient

This repository contains the software implementation of a neural network-based computational algorithm designed to predict the Chezy roughness coefficient. The neural network architecture consists of 2 hidden layers and is optimized for accurate predictions in hydrodynamics and fluid mechanics.

## Features

- Neural network model with 2 hidden layers; the output neuron is linear, while the hidden layer neurons use a sigmoid activation function.
- Uses the backpropagation method for neural network training.
- Predicts the Chezy roughness coefficient, an essential parameter in hydraulics.
- Designed for use in computational fluid dynamics and related fields.
- Implemented using modern machine learning techniques.

## Main Components

-	C_EANN_training.py - A Python module implementing the computational algorithm for training the neural network. Uses data from Training_Data.xlsx.
-	C_EANN_calculating.py - A Python module implementing the computational algorithm for predicting the Chezy roughness coefficient using the neural network.
